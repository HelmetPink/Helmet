It is interesting that on the BSports platform, users can play two roles; that is, the dealer can also be a speculator, this is a multi-end game process, when predicting a football match, when you speculator identity bet A team win, when over time, you If you think team A has no chance of winning, then you can continue to switch to team B or crazy in the liquidity pool to bet money (the dealer itself has a certain dealer advantage) to make up for the loss that team A may bring you, of course, when injected or slightly calculate the profit and loss.",
